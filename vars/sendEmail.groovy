/**
 * Email Extension plugin helper for sending automatic build status emails under
 * two circumstances: (1) when a build fails or is unstable (2) when a
 * previously-unstable/failed build now succeeds (_ie_ is fixed).
 *
 * Example usage within a declarative pipeline:
 *
 *    steps {
 *        sendEmail currentBuild, ['example@example.com']
 *    }
 *
 * Note that `currentBuild` is a Jenkins-provided object that is always available.
 *
 * @param currentBuild a Jenkins RunWrapper object for the current build
 * @param emailList a list of recipients' email addresses
